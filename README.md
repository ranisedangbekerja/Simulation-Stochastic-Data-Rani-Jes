# Purpose #
This simulation aims to understand the impact of controversial content on virality, considering various factors such as:

# Number of Followers #
1. Use of Hashtags and Mentions
2. Likes
3. Comments
4. Reposts

# About the Dataset #
The dataset used in this simulation is derived from real data scraped from two Twitter accounts known for their controversial content. The focus is on how these variables interact to influence the virality of posts.

# Definition of Controversial #
For the purpose of this study, controversial content is defined based on our subjective judgment. Specifically, we consider content related to LGBT topics as controversial. This definition is used consistently throughout the simulation.
